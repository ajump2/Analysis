\textbf{Definition 1.5.1.}\\ Let $A$ be a nonempty set of real numbers.\\
(a) $M$ is the maximum of $A$ if $M$ is in $A$ and $x \leq M$ for all $x$ in $A$.\\
(b) $m$ is the minimum of $A$ if $m$ is in $A$ and $m \leq x$ for all $x$ in $A$.\\
\textbf{Definition 1.5.2}\\
Let $A$ be a set of real numbers.\\
(a) A number $M$ is an upper bound for $A$ if $x \leq M$ for all $x$ in $A$. We say that $A$ is bounded above if it has an upper bound.\\
(b) A number $m$ is a lower bound for $A$ if $x \geq m$ for all $x$ in $A$. We say that $A$ is bounded below if it has a lower bound.\\
(c) $A$ is bounded if it is bounded both above and below.\\
\textbf{Definition 1.5.3}\\
Let $A$ be a nonempty set of real numbers.\\
(a) $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is a least upper bound for $A$ if $\alpha$ is an upper bound for $A$ and $\alpha \leq M$ for any upper bound $M$ of $A$.\\
(b) $B$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is a greatest lower bound for $A$ if $B$ is a lower bound for $A$ and $B \geq m$ for any lower bound $m$ of $A$.\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.5.4} If the set $A \neq \emptyset$ has a least upper bound, it is unique, and similarly, if $A$ has a greatest lower bound, it is unique.\\
\textbf{Notation:} We denote the least upper bound of a set $A$ by $\lub{A}$, and the greatest lower bound by $\glb{}$, whenever they exist. we will also use $\lub{}$ and $\glb{}$ as abbreviations for the phrases "least upper bound" and "greatest lower bound" respectively.\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.5.8.} For $A \neq \emptyset$, $\glb{A} \leq \lub{A}$ if they both exist.\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.5.9} If $B \subset A$, then $\glb{A} \leq \glb{B} \leq \lub{B} \leq \lub{A}$, provided all four exist.\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.5.10.}\\
(a) Let $\alpha$ be an upper bound for $A$. Then $\alpha = \lub{A}$ if and only if for any $u < \alpha,$ there is an $x$ in $A$ with $u \leq x < \alpha.$\\
(b) Let $\beta$ be a lower bound for $A$. Then $\beta = \glb{A}$ if and only if for any $\gamma > \beta$, there is an $x$ in $A$ with $\beta \leq x<\gamma$.\\
\textbf{Least Upper Bound Axiom.} Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound.\\
\textbf{Corollary 1.5.11} Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound.\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.5.12} $\mathbb{N}$ is not bounded above.\\
\textbf{Corollary 1.5.13} For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there is an $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$.\\\\
An equivalent result, provable in a similar way, states that if $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary real numbers With $x > o$, then there is an $n$ from $N$ With $y < nx$. This is called the Archimedean property of the real numbers. we will not need this result; its proof is left for the exercises (Problem 15).\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.5.14} For every pair of numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$, there is a rational number $r$ such that $a < r < b$.\\
\textbf{Corollary 1.5.15} Every open interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many rationals.\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.5.16} For every non-negative number $a$, there is a unique non-negative number $b$ for which $b^2 = a$. (This justifies the definition of $a$ in Section 1.3.)\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.5.17} $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational.\\
\textbf{Corollary 1.5.18} Every open interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many irrationals.\\
\textbf{Definition 1.5.19} Let $A \subset B$\\
(a) If $A$ has no upper bound, then We say that $\lub{A} = \infty$.\\
(b) If $A$ has no lower bound, then we say that $\glb{A} = -\infty$\\
(c) We define $\lub{\emptyset} = -\infty$ and $\glb{\emptyset} = \infty$.\\
